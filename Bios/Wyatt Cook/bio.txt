Hi, I am Wyatt Cook and I am a sophomore in the McCormick School of Engineering studying Computer Science and getting a certificate of entrepreneurship.  
I am working on Darwin for two main reasons: First of all, I want to learn how to work with robots, and learn valuable coding skills along the way.
Second of all, I want to help make something really awesome.  One thing unique about me is that I can bend my elbow pretty weirdly.

Outside of Darwin, I am involved in ISBE Arch, an entrepreneurial group on campus, am a EECS 111 TA, 
and have a start-up called NoteShark with two friends.   In addition, I am a huge soccer player and fan, playing a lot of pickup at Northwestern,
as well as watching soccer on tv.  If you see me wearing a soccer jersey around, it's probably from my favorite team, Everton.  
I also am a big baseball fan, and love watching baseball over the summer with my family and crunching the stats along the way.
