Yannick's Bio

I am a sophomore in McCormick majoring in Computer Science. I joined the Robotics Club to build on my coding skills and try a new adventure.

Outside of this, I am involved in EPIC where I'm part of the organizing comitte for WildHacks (Northwestern's intercollegiate hackathon) and often play pick upsoccer at school.
