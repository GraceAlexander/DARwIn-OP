\f0\fs24 \cf2 My name is Jared Schifrien and I am a sophomore computer science student in the McCormick school of Engineering at Northwestern University.  I am working on the Darwin project because I want to gain more experience in one of the coolest fields, robotics.  Furthermore, I want to develop my programming skills while working on something both helpful and incredibly awesome.\
\
In addition to the Darwin project, I am also an android developer for Mayfest, a Northwestern that plans and produces the largest student run music festival in the country.  In addition, I am in a student government committee that does web and mobile development for the Northwestern student body.  Furthermore, I am a member of the production team of A&O, a campus organization that brings concerts, speakers and films to campus for the student body.}
